# AI-Based Vehicle Failure Prediction System

This project implements a predictive maintenance system using machine learning
to detect vehicle failures and identify failure types.

## Features
- Binary failure prediction with probability output
- Threshold tuning for imbalance handling
- Multiclass failure type classification
- Streamlit-based demo application

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/app.py
